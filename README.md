# Number Algorithms Implementation in Rust

A **didactic implementation** of number theory algorithms in Rust, including:

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: For generating prime numbers
- **GF(2) Field**: Partial implementation of the finite field with 2 elements
- **Matrix Operations**: Over GF(2) for linear algebra computations
- **Quadratic Sieve**: A general-purpose integer factorization algorithm

## Overview

This project implements several number theory algorithms with a focus on clarity and pedagogical value. The code is structured to clearly show each step of the mathematical processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Installation & Running

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/v-espitalier/numbers-rs.git
$ cd numbers-rs
$ cargo run
```
